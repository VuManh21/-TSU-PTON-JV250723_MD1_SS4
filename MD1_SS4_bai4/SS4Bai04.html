    <p>A website (also written as a web site) is any <a href="">web page</a> whose content is identified by a common
       <a href=""> domain</a> name and is published on at least one <a href="">web server.</a>
        Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
        entertainment, or <a href="">social media</a>.
        Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a <a href="">home page</a>.
        The <a href="">most-visited</a> sites are <a href="">Google, YouTube</a>, and <a href="">Facebook</a>.

        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <a href="">World Wide Web</a>.
        There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <a href="">private network</a>, such as a company's internal
        website for its employees.
        <a href="">Users</a> can access websites on a range of devices, including<a href=""> desktops, laptops, tablets, </a>and<a href=""> smartphones.</a>
        The app used on these devices is called a<a href=""> web browser.</a></p>
